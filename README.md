Archived in favor of https://github.com/Zaechus/artix-installer

## Usage

1. Run `sh preinstall.sh` to connect to the internet and install Python.
2. Run `python install.py`.
3. Run `artix-chroot /mnt /bin/bash`.
4. Run `python /root/iamchroot.py` in the new system.
5. When `iamchroot.py` finishes, `exit` the chroot, `umount -R /mnt` if you want, and `poweroff`.

## Assumptions

* These scripts assume you are already booted into the Artix live disk or you at least have `artools` (it may be called something else now) on your system and have loaded all of the scripts in some way. In the live environment, I just used another USB drive that had the scripts and mounted it, but you can probably use `git` or `wget` the raw files directly.
* It also assumes you want what it wants and adhere to the occasional instructions it gives you, the user, to perform.
* The scripts also *_don't_* make assumptions about your hardware and will automatically use both AMD and Intel ucode initrd images.

## What you get

An encrypted Artix Linux system with OpenRC and Btrfs subvols for root, snapshots, and home. Only necessary packages are installed with a few minor exceptions for flavor or the install process (`python`, `zsh`, `neovim`, `neofetch`). Also note that `install.py` and `iamchroot.py` are copied to `/root` during the installation process.

Post-installation networking is done with `connman`.
